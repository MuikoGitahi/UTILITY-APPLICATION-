# Dart Programming Exercises

This project demonstrates key Dart concepts including string manipulation, collections, file handling, and date/time operations. Each section outlines the functionality you will build as part of a small application.

## String Manipulation

Implement a program that demonstrates the following string operations:
- **Concatenation**: Join two or more strings.
- **Interpolation**: Insert variables into a string.
- **Substring Extraction**: Extract a part of a string.
- **Case Conversion**: Convert strings to uppercase or lowercase.
- **Additional Features**:
  - Reverse a string.
  - Count the length of the string.

## Collections (Lists, Sets, Maps)

Create a Dart program to showcase the following collections and their operations:
- **Lists**: Ordered collections of items.
- **Sets**: Unordered collections of unique items.
- **Maps**: Key-value pairs.
  
### Operations:
- Add, remove, and iterate over items.
- Highlight scenarios where each collection type is most appropriate.

## File Handling

Write a Dart program to perform file operations:
- **Read from a file**: Load content from an existing file.
- **Write to a file**: Create or modify a file by writing new content.
- Handle errors gracefully during file operations.

## Date and Time

Create a program using Dart's `DateTime` class to:
- **Format and parse dates**: Change how dates are represented.
- **Manipulate dates**: Add or subtract days, months, etc.
- **Calculate date differences**: Find the duration between two dates.

## Exercise: Build a Small Application

Combine the above utilities to create a small application with the following functionality:
- **String Manipulation**: Perform operations on user input (concatenation, case conversion, etc.).
- **Store Results**: Save the results in a collection.
- **File Storage**: Write the manipulated data to a file.
- **Date and Time Logging**: Record when each entry was made using Dart's date and time utilities.
